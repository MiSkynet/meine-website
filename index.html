                    <p class="small-content">
                        Hello, I am Michele aka MiSkynet. I'm 16 years old and I'm interested in programming.
                        I mainly develop plugins for the game Minecraft, but I also like to test myself in
                        python or in html and css (that's how this website was created.)
                    </p>

                    <p class="small-content">
                        As I am only 16 years old, I have not been able to gain any experience in a 
                        profession. I did an internship for a week in 2023, but that's all there is to tell.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="hover-grow top-spacing fade-in">
                    <p class="middle-heading">My beginning</p>

                    <p class="small-content">
                        But how did it all start? In mid-2021, I started teaching myself Java with the help of 
                        YouTube videos. 2 years later, in 2023, I started learning HTML and CSS on the side. 
                        Then, in 2024, I lost motivation and interest in programming and took a break until 
                        I started again at the end of 2024. Since then, I've been trying to teach myself 
                        programming, again focusing on HTML, CSS and Java. In 2023, as I mentioned before, 
                        I did a week-long internship at a small company. Unfortunately, the internship only 
                        showed me which direction I don't want to go in. So it was useful, I guess?

                    <p class="middle-heading">How are things going at the moment?</p>

                    <p class="small-content">
                        I have a lot of fun programming because since I started it has become easier to learn 
                        programming (with the help of ai). I don't put any pressure on myself and concentrate 
                        on what I want to learn.

                    <p class="small-content">
                        I am currently attending a grammar school and plan to study afterwards. I'm still not 
                        sure what exactly I want to study, as I'm interested in web development, but also in
                         cyber security and developing desktop apps. I hope I can find out more about what 
                         I want to do through my “self-learning action” in order to find the job that I enjoy.
